# Custom Traffic Intersection Controller

Team Members: William Lu, Kathryn Hite

## Project Description
We will develop a system of car and pedestrian traffic signals as well as an intersection controller.  To accomplish this, we will create the circuit diagrams for the relevant traffic signals and controller, develop a verilog simulation, and research various methods of traffic control.

## Deliverables
**Minimum Goals**

Simple, four-way intersection with timer based traffic control:

* Circuits for car traffic signals, pedestrian traffic signals, and controller
* Verilog simulation of system
* Testbench showing correct signaling

**Planned Goals**

Extension 1

* Add the circuit for a turn lane signal and integrate it into the traffic controller

Extension 2

* Adaptive traffic control using sensor inputs to determine the frequency of passing cars and/or pedestrians

**Stretch Goals**

Apply our adaptive traffic control system to a complex intersection or system of intersections
